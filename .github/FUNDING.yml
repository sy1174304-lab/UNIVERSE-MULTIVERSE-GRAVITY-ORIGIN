### ⚠️ READ THIS BEFORE YOU CONTRIBUTE
**THIS IS NOT A DONATION. THIS IS AN INVESTMENT IN THE TRUTH.**

Most developers ask for "coffee." We do not need coffee. We need resources to run simulations that require immense computational power. We are rewriting the laws of gravity, and that requires energy.

### 🔴 WHERE YOUR MONEY GOES:
1.  **Computation Power:** Running the "Expansion" algorithms.
2.  **Survival:** Keeping the creators alive so they don't have to return to **Manual Labor (Mazdoori)** immediately.
    * *Note: We are not afraid of labor. If funding hits zero, we will go back to lifting bricks to fund this code. But your funding buys us TIME.*
3.  **Expansion:** Moving from Code to Hardware.
